Recommendation:
Start with Array-Based Queue and Linked List-Based Queue to understand basic queue operations and memory management.
Implement a Circular Queue and Dynamic Array-Based Queue to explore different ways of handling memory efficiently.
Try a Priority Queue to learn about heap structures and their applications in algorithms.
Consider a Concurrent Queue if you're interested in multi-threaded programming.


---------------------------


Yes, the interface you’ve defined can be followed by all the queue types mentioned. Here’s how each queue type can be adapted to this interface:

1. Array-Based Queue
enqueue(T data): Adds an element to the rear of the array-based queue.
dequeue(): Removes and returns the front element of the queue.
display(): Prints the elements in the queue from front to rear.
front(): Returns the front element of the queue.
rear(): Returns the rear element of the queue.
is_empty(): Checks if the queue is empty.
size(): Returns the number of elements in the queue.

2. Linked List-Based Queue
enqueue(T data): Adds an element to the rear of the linked list.
dequeue(): Removes and returns the front element of the linked list.
display(): Traverses and prints the elements from the front to the rear of the linked list.
front(): Returns the front element of the linked list.
rear(): Returns the rear element (last node) of the linked list.
is_empty(): Checks if the linked list is empty.
size(): Returns the number of elements in the linked list.

3. Dynamic Array-Based Queue
enqueue(T data): Adds an element to the rear, resizing the array if necessary.
dequeue(): Removes and returns the front element, potentially shifting elements.
display(): Prints the elements from front to rear.
front(): Returns the front element.
rear(): Returns the rear element.
is_empty(): Checks if the queue is empty.
size(): Returns the number of elements.

4. Double-Ended Queue (Deque)
enqueue(T data): Adds an element to the rear.
dequeue(): Removes and returns the front element.
display(): Prints all elements, which can be implemented for both ends.
front(): Returns the front element.
rear(): Returns the rear element.
is_empty(): Checks if the deque is empty.
size(): Returns the number of elements.

5. Priority Queue
enqueue(T data): Adds an element based on priority.
dequeue(): Removes and returns the element with the highest priority.
display(): Prints elements, typically sorted by priority.
front(): Returns the highest-priority element.
rear(): Can be used to return the lowest-priority element, though this is less common.
is_empty(): Checks if the priority queue is empty.
size(): Returns the number of elements.

6. Circular Queue
enqueue(T data): Adds an element, handling circular indexing.
dequeue(): Removes and returns the front element, adjusting indices.
display(): Prints elements considering the circular nature.
front(): Returns the front element.
rear(): Returns the rear element.
is_empty(): Checks if the queue is empty.
size(): Returns the number of elements.

7. Concurrent Queue (Thread-Safe Queue)
enqueue(T data): Adds an element with thread safety.
dequeue(): Removes and returns the front element with thread safety.
display(): Prints elements, possibly requiring synchronization.
front(): Returns the front element with thread safety.
rear(): Returns the rear element with thread safety.
is_empty(): Checks if the queue is empty with thread safety.
size(): Returns the number of elements with thread safety.

8. Persistent Queue
enqueue(T data): Creates a new version of the queue with the added element.
dequeue(): Creates a new version with the front element removed.
display(): Prints elements from the current version.
front(): Returns the front element from the current version.
rear(): Returns the rear element from the current version.
is_empty(): Checks if the current version is empty.
size(): Returns the number of elements in the current version.
